	abstract = {This article proposes a generalized modeling and simulation approach for correlated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) texture based on the Gaussian coherent scatterer model. It is rooted in the physics-based coherent scatterer assumption where each observation in an SAR image is a coherent sum of multiple underlying Gaussian scatterers. The proposal generalizes existing single-point statistical models by allowing the number of scatterers to be a correlated random field. It can also generate the desired spatial correlation texture by stipulating the structure in both the Gaussian scattered field and the number of scatterers. This generalized model is derived theoretically and then validated by both simulations and experiments with SAR data from actual sensors.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides consistent information on target land features; especially in tropical conditions that restrain penetration of optical imaging sensors. Because radar response signal is influenced by geometric and di-electrical properties of surface features’, the different land cover may appear similar in radar images. For discriminating perennial cocoa agroforestry land cover, we compare a multi-spectral optical image from RapidEye, acquired in the dry season, and multi-seasonal C-band SAR of Sentinel 1: A final set of 10 (out of 50) images that represent six dry and four wet seasons from 2015 to 2017. We ran eight RF models for different input band combinations; multi-spectral reflectance, vegetation indices, co-(VV) and cross-(VH) polarised SAR intensity and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures. Following a pixel-based image analysis, we evaluated accuracy metrics and uncertainty Shannon entropy. The model comprising co- and cross-polarised texture bands had the highest accuracy of 88.07% (95% CI: 85.52 - 90.31) and kappa of 85.37; and the low class uncertainty for perennial agroforests and transition forests. The optical image had low classification uncertainty for the entire image; but, it performed better in discriminating non-vegetated areas. The measured uncertainty provides reliable validation for comparing class discrimination from different image resolution. The GLCM texture measures that are crucial in delineating vegetation cover differed for the season and polarization of SAR image. Given the high accuracies of mapping, our approach has value for landscape monitoring; and, an improved valuation of agroforestry contribution to REDD+ strategies in the Congo basin sub-region.},

  abstract = {Mineral exploration and geological mapping of highly prospective areas in western Tasmania, southern Australia, is challenging due to steep topography, dense vegetation, and limited outcrop. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can potentially penetrate vegetation canopies and assist geological mapping in this environment. This study applies manual and automated lithological classification methods to airborne polarimetric TopSAR and geophysical data in the Heazlewood region, western Tasmania. Major discrepancies between classification results and the existing geological map generated fieldwork targets that led to the discovery of previously unmapped rock units. Manual analysis of radar image texture was essential for the identification of lithological boundaries. Automated pixel-based classification of radar data using Random Forests achieved poor results despite the inclusion of textural information derived from gray level co-occurrence matrices. This is because the majority of manually identified features within the radar imagery result from geobotanical and geomorphological relationships, rather than direct imaging of surficial lithological variations. Inconsistent relationships between geology and vegetation or geology and topography limit the reliability of TopSAR interpretations for geological mapping in this environment. However, Random Forest classifications, based on geophysical data and validated against manual interpretations, were accurate (~90%) even when using limited training data (~0.15% of total data). These classifications identified a previously unmapped region of mafic-ultramafic rocks, the presence of which was verified through fieldwork. This study validates the application of machine learning for geological mapping in remote and inaccessible localities but also highlights the limitations of SAR data in thickly vegetated terrain.},

In this context, land cover maps of remote sensing data are the most commonly used EO products and development of adequate classification strategies is an ongoing research topic. However, the availability of meaningful multispectral data sets can be limited due to cloud cover, particularly in the tropics. In such regions, the use of SAR systems (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which are nearly independent form weather conditions, is particularly promising. With an ever-growing number of SAR satellites, as well as the increasing accessibility of SAR data, potentials for multi-frequency remote sensing are becoming numerous. In our study, we evaluate the synergistic contribution of multitemporal L-, C-, and X-band data to tropical land cover mapping. We compare classification outcomes of ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets for a study site in the Brazilian Amazon using a wrapper approach. After preprocessing and calculation of GLCM texture (Grey Level Co-Occurence), the wrapper utilizes Random Forest classifications to estimate scene importance. Comparing the contribution of different wavelengths, ALOS-2 data perform best in terms of overall classification accuracy, while the classification of TerraSAR-X data yields higher accuracies when compared to the results achieved by RADARSAT-2. Moreover, the wrapper underlines potentials of multi-frequency classification as integration of multi-frequency images is always preferred over multi-temporal, mono-frequent composites. We conclude that, despite distinct advantages of certain sensors, for land cover classification, multi-sensoral integration is beneficial.},

This event highlighted the importance of an operational sea-ice classification map for ice routing to serve ship navigation. In this paper, unprecedented Antarctic sea-ice classification algorithms from RADARSAT-2 satellite dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were developed using the conditional random fields (CRF) approach by including multiple features from sea-ice concentration, gray-level cooccurrence matrix textures, polarization ratio, backscatter coefficients, and intensity data. Coincident RADARSAT-2 Satellite SAR datasets with five scenes were collected for ice classification into categories such as open water, thin ice, smooth first year ice, deformed first year ice, and old ice during the CHINARE-30th cruise. The effects of deformation, rafting, and ridging during the spring-summer transition period were overwhelmed by the spatial and contextual CRF models in combination with the rich features extracted for sea-ice classification. Four strategies including statistical distribution and region connection, multiple features and support vector machine (SVM) integrated into the CRF model are proposed to describe the sea-ice-type relationships among pixels. By conducting comparative experiments between the proposed methods and state-of-the-art sea-ice classification based on the SVM algorithm, the best was obtained from the SVM-based CRF (SVM-CRF) algorithm for sea-ice classification with respect to the three scenes from the Indian Ocean sector and two scenes of Pacific Ocean sectors including medium-resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 50 m and higher resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 6.25 m. Results indicate that the SVM-CRF approach has the capacity for improving sea-ice classification, which can provide accurate and reliable sea-ice class information for sea-ice analysis.},

The main characteristic of the proposed model is to simultaneously use Dirac and Lebesgue measures at the class chain level. This allows the coexistence of hard pixels (obtained with the classical HMC segmentation) and fuzzy pixels (obtained with the fuzzy measure) in the same image. The quality assessment of the proposed method is achieved with several bidate sets of simulated images, and comparisons with classical HMC are also provided.

Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern.

Edges are allocated between nodes based on temporal succession thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the Rössler system and find that periodic dynamics translate to ring structures whereas chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures—thereby indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive to system dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple network measures including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov exponent.

A relevant issue is to understand how such systems represent, via correlated spikes, the information of a weak external input. Semiconductor lasers with optical feedback operating in the low frequency fluctuations regime have been shown to display optical spikes with intrinsic temporal correlations similar to those of biological neurons. Here we investigate how the spiking laser output represents a weak periodic input that is implemented via direct modulation of the laser pump current. We focus on understanding the influence of the modulation frequency. Experimental sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) are recorded and analyzed by using the ordinal symbolic methodology that identifies and characterizes serial correlations in datasets. The change in the statistics of the various symbols with the modulation frequency is empirically shown to be related to specific changes in the ISI distribution, which arise due to different phase-locking regimes. A good qualitative agreement is also found between simulations of the Lang and Kobayashi model and observations. This methodology is an efficient way to detect subtle changes in noisy correlated ISI sequences and may be applied to investigate other optical excitable devices.},

Furthermore, we propose a measure of entropy to characterize ordinal partition transition dynamics, which is sensitive to capturing the possible local geometric changes of phase space trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of pattern transition networks to capture phase coherence to non-coherence transitions, and to characterize paths to phase synchronizations.

  abstract = {Classification based on polarimetric data alone does not provide sufficient sensitivity for classes’ separation such as forests. The use of other characteristics such as texture provides a powerful tool to get better class discrimination. Thus, this article outlines an approach for texture modelling adapted to land identification using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. As radar images may contain a myriad of textures and to take into account their non-stationarity feature, the model is non-parametric and is based on a likeness measure between neighbourhoods. This measure is incorporated in probability formulation of the textural model. The latter is validated through texture synthesis applied to Brodatz’ natural textures. While having multiple applications, we focused here on the issue of terrain mapping of PolSAR images. Using Bayesian approach and some basic assumptions, we defined a classification scheme based on the textural model. It was tested on original Pauli decomposed images and filtered ones. The test area used is the Oberpfaffenhofen in Munich and the PolSAR images were acquired in the P band. For evaluation purposes, the classifications results obtained were compared with the Wishart classifier result performed on H–α partition showing interesting results and reaching classification rates ≈90%. Such an analysis has allowed us to assess the importance of texture considering and proved that the proposed texture model is able to describe the target's physical properties of PolSAR data.},

A new efficient algorithm for Gabor-filter design is presented, along with methods for estimating filter output statistics. The algorithm draws upon previous results that showed that the output of a Gabor-filtered texture is modeled well by a Rician distribution. A measure of the total output power is used to select the center frequency of the filter and is used to estimate the Rician statistics of the Gabor-filtered image. The method is further generalized to include the statistics of postfiltered outputs that are generated by a Gaussian filtering operation following the Gabor filter. The new method typically requires an order of magnitude less computation to design a filter than a previously proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the method.},

Lett. 88 174102], Bandt and Pompe propose permutation entropy (PE) as a natural complexity measure for arbitrary time series which may be stationary or nonstationary, deterministic or stochastic. Their method is based on a comparison of neighbouring values. This paper further develops PE, and proposes the concept of fine-grained PE (FGPE) defined by the order pattern and magnitude of the difference between neighbouring values. This measure excludes the case where vectors with a distinct appearance are mistakenly mapped onto the same permutation type, and consequently FGPE becomes more sensitive to the dynamical change of time series than does PE, according to our simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Signal segmentation and spike detection are two important biomedical signal processing applications. Often, non-stationary signals must be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs or spikes need to be found among a background of noise before being further analyzed. Permutation entropy (PE) has been proposed to evaluate the irregularity of a time series. PE is conceptually simple, structurally robust to artifacts, and computationally fast. It has been extensively used in many applications, but it has two key shortcomings. First, when a signal is symbolized using the Bandt-Pompe procedure, only the order of the amplitude values is considered and information regarding the amplitudes is discarded. Second, in the PE, the effect of equal amplitude values in each embedded vector is not addressed. To address these issues, we propose a new entropy measure based on PE: the amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE). Methods: AAPE is sensitive to the changes in the amplitude, in addition to the frequency, of the signals thanks to it being more flexible than the classical PE in the quantification of the signal motifs. To demonstrate how the AAPE method can enhance the quality of the signal segmentation and spike detection, a set of synthetic and realistic synthetic neuronal signals, electroencephalograms and neuronal data are processed. We compare the performance of AAPE in these problems against state-of-the-art approaches and evaluate the significance of the differences with a repeated ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. Results: In signal segmentation, the accuracy of AAPE-based method is higher than conventional segmentation methods. AAPE also leads to more robust results in the presence of noise. The spike detection results show that AAPE can detect spikes well, even when presented with single-sample spikes, unlike PE. For multi-sample spikes, the changes in AAPE are larger than in PE. Conclusion: We introduce a new entropy metric, AAPE, that enables us to consider amplitude information in the formulation of PE. The AAPE algorithm can be used in almost every irregularity-based application in various signal and image processing fields. We also made freely available the Matlab code of the AAPE.},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image land-cover classification is an important research topic in SAR image interpretation. However, speckle, inherent of active coherent imaging systems, diminishes the performances of feature extraction techniques and classifiers. In this article, we firstly present a simple yet powerful feature extraction method based on the covariance matrix of textural feature. In comparison with the original textural feature, the use of second-order statistics makes the proposed covariance descriptor more distinguishable for various land covers and robust to speckle noise. Considering that the covariance descriptors are symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which form a Riemannian manifold, we then propose to map the manifold with Log-Euclidean metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space by means of the positive definite kernel defined on manifolds. As a result, the kernel not only allows us to make full use of algorithms developed for linear spaces but also preserves geometric structure of SPD matrices. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide promising results in terms of classification accuracy and label consistency.},
